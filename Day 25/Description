Topic: Doubly Circular Linked List
Question: Create a Doubly linked list and perform insertion, deletetion & display.

In this program we create a Doubly Circular Linked List 

What is Doubly Circular Linked List ?

Circular doubly linked list is a more complexed type of data structure in which a node contain pointers to its previous node as well as the next node. Circular doubly linked list doesn't contain NULL in any of the node. The last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. The first node of the list also contain address of the last node in its previous pointer.

Here first we create a class name Node using which we create a container for the linked list which will contain the value and the pointer of a specific node.

Insertion is done at :-
# insertion at beginning
# insertion at mid
# insertion at end

Deletion is done at :-
# deletion at beginning
# deletion at mid
# deletion at end

Then tere is display function which display the entire linked list

# Sample input
7
8
9
6
5


6
5
3
10

# Sample output

7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6 -> 5 -> END

6 -> 5 -> 100 -> 3 -> 10 -> END
