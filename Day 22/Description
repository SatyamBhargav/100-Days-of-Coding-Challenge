Topic : Linked List
Question : Create a singly linked list and perform insertion, deletetion & display.

In this program we create a singly linked list 

What is linked list ?

Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.

Here first create a class name Node using which we create a container for the linked list which will contain the value and the pointer of a specific node.

Insertion is done at :-
# insertion at beginning
# insertion at mid
# insertion at end

Deletion is done at :-
# deletion at beginning
# deletion at mid
# deletion at end

Then tere is display function which display the entire linked list

# Sample input
6
5
3
10
100     3       where 100 - value & 3 - index

# Sample output

6 -> 5 -> 100 -> 3 -> 10 -> END
