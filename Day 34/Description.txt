Question: Using Java program explain the working of Binary Semaphore

What is File Writer?
The binary semaphores are quite similar to counting semaphores, but their value is restricted to 0 and 1. 
In this type of semaphore, the wait operation works only if semaphore = 1, and the signal operation succeeds when semaphore= 0. 
It is easy to implement than counting semaphores.
