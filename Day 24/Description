Topic: Doubly Linked List
Question: Create a Doubly linked list and perform insertion, deletetion & display.

In this program we create a Doubly Linked List

What is Doubly linked list ?

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).

Here first we create a class name Node using which we create a container for the linked list which will contain the value and the pointer of a specific node.

Insertion is done at :-
# insertion at beginning
# insertion at mid
# insertion at end

Deletion is done at :-
# deletion at beginning
# deletion at mid
# deletion at end

Then tere is display function which display the entire linked list

# Sample input
7
8
9
6
5


6
5
3
10

# Sample output

7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6 -> 5 -> END

6 -> 5 -> 100 -> 3 -> 10 -> END
